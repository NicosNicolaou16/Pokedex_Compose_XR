# Pokedex Compose XR

Pokedex Compose XR is an open-source project that blends the charm of the Pokédex with cutting-edge
Extended Reality (XR) experiences, powered by Jetpack Compose. Built on top of the early-access
AndroidX XR library, it showcases how immersive Pokémon data visualization can work across AR and VR
devices.

Key features include:

- Immersive Pokémon browsing – View Pokémon models, stats, and details in a fully spatial
  environment.

- Compose-driven UI – Leverage the power of Jetpack Compose to create responsive, dynamic XR
  layouts.

- Interaction experiments – Test gesture controls, spatial navigation, and XR-native interface
  patterns.

- Extensible architecture – Replace datasets, plug in new XR hardware, or adapt it for other 3D
  catalog experiences.

Pokedex Compose XR is both a showcase and a playground for developers interested in building XR apps
with the AndroidX XR library, offering real-world examples to accelerate experimentation and
learning.
